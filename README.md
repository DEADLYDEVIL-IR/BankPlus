### Recent Updates
In the 2.0 version, BankPlus is now able to use __Custom Heads__ in the GUI, and you can do it by typing:

`HEAD-%PLAYER%` / `HEAD-PlayerName` / `HEAD-<textureValue,textureSignature>`

These are 3 methods to create a custom HEAD, for more info, read the [wiki](https://github.com/Pulsih/BankPlus/wiki) about Custom Heads
